I am a postdoctoral fellow at the [Astrophysics Group, Cavendish Laboratory](https://www.astro.phy.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge, supported by the [Blavatnik Cambridge Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://www.britishcouncil.org.il/en/blavatnik-cambridge-postdoctoral-fellows). I work within [Didier Queloz’s group](https://www.astro.phy.cam.ac.uk/directory/prof-didier-queloz), where my research focuses on understanding stars in their Galactic context—particularly halo stars and the field of Galactic archaeology. I explore the occurrence and properties of exoplanets and binary stars in these ancient stellar populations, aiming to uncover how they formed and evolved.

In parallel, I study dormant compact objects in binary systems—such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes—as well as compact hierarchical multiple systems, which provide unique insights into stellar evolution and dynamical interactions.

Previously, I was a research associate at the [Department of Astrophysics, Tel Aviv University (TAU)](https://en-exact-sciences.tau.ac.il/), where I collaborated with [Tsevi Mazeh](https://en-exact-sciences.tau.ac.il/profile/mazeh) on exoplanet and binary-star research. My Ph.D., supervised by [Shay Zucker](https://english.tau.ac.il/profile/shayz), focused on characterising the demographics of exoplanets within the Galactic context.

In addition, as part of TAU’s [Nanosatellite and Space Engineering Centre](https://space.tau.ac.il/), I contributed as a systems engineer to the development and integration of CubeSats and space-based experiments launched to the International Space Station (ISS) and Low-Earth Orbit (LEO).
