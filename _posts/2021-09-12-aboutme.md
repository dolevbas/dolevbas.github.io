I'm an astrophysics Ph.D student at Tel-Aviv university (TAU), where I do research in planetary science and especially Exoplanets under the supervision 
of Prof. [Shay Zucker](https://english.tau.ac.il/profile/shayz).

In addition, being a member of TAU's Nanosatellite and space engineering center, I'm the system engineer in charge of the development and integration testing of nanosatellites and other space based experiments sent to the ISS.
