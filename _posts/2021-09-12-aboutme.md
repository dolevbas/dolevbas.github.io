I am a postdoctoral fellow at the [Astrophysics Group, Cavendish Laboratory](https://www.astro.phy.cam.ac.uk/), University of Cambridge, as part of the [Blavatnik Cambridge Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://www.britishcouncil.org.il/en/blavatnik-cambridge-postdoctoral-fellows). I am currently working within [Didier Queloz’s group](https://www.astro.phy.cam.ac.uk/directory/prof-didier-queloz). My research focuses on understanding stars in the Galactic context, with a particular emphasis on halo stars and galactic archaeology. I explore and search for exoplanets and binary stars in these stellar populations, contributing to our understanding of their formation and evolution.

In addition, I investigate dormant compact objects in binary systems, such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes, as well as compact hierarchical systems.

Previously, I was a research associate at Tel-Aviv University’s (TAU) Astrophysics Department, where I collaborated with [Prof. Tsevi Mazeh]((https://en-exact-sciences.tau.ac.il/profile/mazeh)) on exoplanet and binary star research. My Ph.D. thesis, supervised by [Prof. Shay Zucker]((https://english.tau.ac.il/profile/shayz)), focused on characterising the demographics of exoplanets within the Galactic context.

As part of my role at TAU’s Nanosatellite and Space Engineering Centre, I also contributed as a system engineer in the development and integration of nanosatellites and space-based experiments sent to the International Space Station (ISS) and Low-Earth Orbit (LEO).
