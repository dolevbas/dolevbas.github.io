I connect system architecture to population-level trends, embedding both exoplanets and binary-star dynamics in their Galactic context. 

## Research threads (at a glance)

- **Planet occurrence in the Galactic context** — how metallicity, α-abundance, kinematics, and disk/halo membership modulate small-planet rates.  
- **System architectures** — metrics to compare whole planetary systems and catalogs (Weighted Energy Distance).  
- **Binary & multiple stars** — demographics across Galactic populations; hierarchical triples; tidal circularization physics.  
- **Dormant compact objects** — wide BH binaries (Gaia BH1–3) and their formation channels.

## Planet Occurrence Rates in the Galactic Context

![HARPS Galactic](/assets/img/HARPSgalactic.jpeg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

We estimate close-in small-planet occurrence across Galactic populations by combining RV and transit surveys with star-by-star injection–recovery and a simplified Bayesian framework. Metal-poor and higher-mass stars host fewer low-mass close-in planets, while thin- and thick-disk rates are comparable in the Solar neighborhood.

## Similarity of Planetary System Architectures

![PASSta](/assets/img/PASSta.jpeg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

We introduce the **Weighted Energy Distance (WED)** to compare full system architectures (period–radius space) and define the **Inter-Catalog Energy Distance (ICED)** to compare *sets* of systems. These tools complement descriptive summaries and enable catalog-to-catalog comparisons.

## The Planetary Mass–Radius Relation

![MR](/assets/img/MR.jpeg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

We identify two regimes in the planetary M–R relation and link the breakpoint to hydrogen electron degeneracy—i.e., the minimal mass of H/He-dominated planets. Observations and population-synthesis models agree qualitatively on this transition.
