My research is focused on exoplanet demographics, characterisation of exoplanets in the Galactic context and planetary system architectures. In my research, I'm attempting to understand the formation and evolution of planetary systems architectures as products of the process of star formation and dynamical evolution.

You can check out some of my papers in this [link](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/filter_author_facet_hier_fq_author=AND&filter_author_facet_hier_fq_author=author_facet_hier%3A%220%2FBashi%2C%20D%22&fq=%7B!type%3Daqp%20v%3D%24fq_database%7D&fq=%7B!type%3Daqp%20v%3D%24fq_author%7D&fq_author=(author_facet_hier%3A%220%2FBashi%2C%20D%22)&fq_database=database%3A%20astronomy&q=author%3A(%22bashi%22)&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0).

And here is a short summary of my recent works:
