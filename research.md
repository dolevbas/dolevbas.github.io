My research is focused on exoplanet demographics, characterisation of exoplanets in the Galactic context and planetary system architectures. In my research, I'm attempting to understand the formation and evolution of planetary systems architectures as products of the process of star formation and dynamical evolution.

You can check out some of my papers in this [link](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=author%3A%22Bashi%2C%20Dolev%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0).

And here is a short summary of my recent works:

### The Similarity of Planetary System Architectures


![Crepe](/assets/img/PASSta.jpeg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

The planetary systems detected so far exhibit a wide diversity of architectures, and various methods have been proposed to quantitatively study this diversity. Straightforward ways to quantify the difference between two systems, and more generally two sets of multi-planetary systems, are helpful for studying this diversity. In this work we present a novel approach, using a weighted extension of the energy distance (WED) metric, to quantify the difference between planetary systems on the logarithmic period-radius plane. We demonstrate the use of this metric and its relation to previously introduced descriptive measures to characterise the arrangements of Kepler planetary systems. By applying exploratory machine-learning tools, we attempt to find whether there is some order that can be ascribed to the set of multi-planet Kepler system architectures. Based on the WED, the `Sequencer', which is such an automatic tool, identifies a progression from small and compact planetary systems to systems with distant giant planets. It is reassuring to see that a WED-based tool does indeed identify this progression. Next, we extend the WED to define the inter-catalogue energy distance - a distance metric between sets of multi-planetary systems. We have made the specific implementation presented in the paper available to the community through a public repository. We suggest using these metrics as complementary tools in attempts to compare different architectures of planetary systems and, in general, different catalogues of planetary systems.

### Planet Occurrence Rates in the Galactic Context 

![Crepe](/assets/img/HARPSgalactic.jpeg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

In the Galactic context, it is currently not fully understood how the structure and evolution of our Galaxy may affect the possibility to form and maintain planets, yet it is clear that our Galaxy is full of planets. As part of my PhD thesis I have worked on estimating planet occurrence rates in the Galactic context. I used both RV and transit search programs and performed injection and recovery tests to constrain the detectability of planets around each star. We've developed a simplified Bayesian method to better constrain the average number of planets per star and the fraction of stars with planets. Our results suggested that metal-poor stars and more massive stars host fewer low-mass close-in planets. We found the occurrence rates of these planets in the thin and thick disks to be comparable. 

This work provides a first estimate of the close-in small planet occurrence rates in the solar neighbourhood of the thin
and thick disks of the Galaxy.

### The Planetary Mass-Radius Relation

![Crepe](/assets/img/MR.jpeg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

We explored the nature of two regimes in the planetary mass-radius (M-R) relation. We suggested that the location of the breakpoint is linked to the onset of electron degeneracy in hydrogen, and therefore to the planetary bulk composition. Specifically, it is the characteristic minimal mass of a planet that consists of mostly hydrogen and helium, and therefore its M-R relation is determined by the equation of state of these materials. We compare the M-R relation from observational data with the relation derived by population synthesis calculations and show that there is a good qualitative agreement between the two samples.
