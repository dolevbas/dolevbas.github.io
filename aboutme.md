I'm an astrophsics Ph.D student at Tel-Aviv university, where I do research at the field of planetary science and especially Exoplanets under the supervision 
of Prof. [Shay Zucker] (https://english.tau.ac.il/profile/shayz).

- I rock a great mustache
- I'm extremely loyal to my family

What else do you need?

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
