I'm a research associate at Tel-Aviv University (TAU) astrophysics department, where I do research in exoplanets and binary stars. My PhD thesis under the supervision of Prof. [Shay Zucker](https://english.tau.ac.il/profile/shayz) was aimed to characterize the demographics of exoplanets in the Galactic context.

In addition, as part of my association to TAU's Nanosatellite and space engineering center, I also take the roll of a system engineer in the development and integration testing of nanosatellites and other space based experiment sent to the ISS.
