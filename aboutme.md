I'm an astrophysics Ph.D student at Tel-Aviv university (TAU), where I do research at the field of planetary science and especially Exoplanets under the supervision 
of Prof. [Shay Zucker](https://english.tau.ac.il/profile/shayz).

In addition, as part of my association to TAU's Nanosatellite and space engineering center, I also take the roll of a system engineer in the development and integration testing of nanosatellites and other space based experiment sent to the ISS.
