Except for my pasion to investigate the mysteries of the universe, I also really like to build stuff. As part of my affiliation to the Nanosatellite and space engineering center at Tel-Aviv university, I was able to combine between both and build stuff that are related to space. I was appointed as Tel-Aviv university first satellite system engineer - TAUSAT-1. I was part of the team that built the satellite and tested it prior to its sucessfull luanch on February 2021.

I'll add some more info about this and other projects that I'm currently working on in the near future, so stay tuned.
