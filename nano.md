Except for my pasions to investigate the mysteries of of the universe I also really like to build stuff. That is why I was very delighted to combine between the two, as part of my affilation to the Nanosatellite and space engineering center at Tel-Aviv university. I was appointed as Tel-Aviv university first satellite system engineer - TAUSAT-1. I was part of the team who bulit the satellite and tested it prior to its sucessfull luanch on February 21.

I'll added some more info about this and other projects that I'm currently working on in the near future, so stay tuned.
