Except for my pasion to investigate the mysteries of the universe, I also really like to build stuff. As part of my affiliation to the Nanosatellite and space engineering center at Tel-Aviv university, I was able to combine between both and build stuff that are related to space. I was appointed as Tel-Aviv university first satellite system engineer - [TAUSAT-1](https://db.satnogs.org/satellite/47926). I was part of the team that built the satellite and tested it prior to its sucessfull luanch on February 2021.

Here is a picture of myself, at TAU's clean room during the satellite development phase:

 You can read more about TAUSAT-1 in this [link](https://english.tau.ac.il/news/tau-sat-1).

I'll add some more info about this and other projects that I'm currently working on in the near future, so stay tuned.
