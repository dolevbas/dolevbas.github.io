Except for my pasion to investigate the mysteries of the universe, I also really like to build stuff. As part of my affiliation to the Nanosatellite and space engineering center at Tel-Aviv university (TAU), I was able to fulfill both of my needs and desgin stuff to explore space. I was appointed as TAU's first satellite system engineer - [TAUSAT-1](https://db.satnogs.org/satellite/47926). I was part of the team that built the satellite and tested it prior to its sucessfull luanch on February 2021.

Here is a picture of myself, at TAU's clean room during the satellite development phase:

You can read more about TAUSAT-1 in this [link](https://english.tau.ac.il/news/tau-sat-1).

In some other projects, I was also invloved in the dvelopment of the [COTS-Capsule](https://english.tau.ac.il/news/tau-sat-1](https://cftau.ca/the-cots-capsule-that-protects-electronic-systems-from-hazardous-radiation-effects-in-space/), an innovative space mechanism for detecting and mitigating cosmic-rays induced damage to space systems.

Currently, I'm also involved in the assembly of a new [optical ground station](https://cftau.ca/out-of-this-world/) at TAU aimed to be used for advanced optical communication with satellites.
